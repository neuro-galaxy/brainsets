## Downloading Matt's data
Links or scripts to download the data should be included in the `README.md` file. Private dataset (like Matt's) are currently available here: [OneDrive](https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/mazabou3_gatech_edu/Documents/Project%20Kirby?csf=1&web=1&e=MZDWEW) (send request to Mehdi for access), and we can plan to consolidate all the data in a single location internally (and publically?) in the future.

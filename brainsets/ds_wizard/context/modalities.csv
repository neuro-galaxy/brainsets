Modality,Description
EEG,"Electroencephalography: Measures brain electrical activity"
EDA,"Electrodermal Activity: Measures changes in skin conductance, related to sweat/arousal"
EMG,"Electromyography: Measures electrical activity of muscles"
RESPIRATORY,"Respiration: Measures breathing rate and effort (e.g., with a chest band)"
PPG,"Photoplethysmography: Measures blood volume changes (commonly used for heart rate)"
TEMPERATURE,"Temperature: Measures body or skin temperature"
STIMULUS,"Stimulus Marker: A trigger or event marker indicating a specific point in time"
EOG,"Electrooculography: Measures eye movements"
ECG,"Electrocardiography: Measures the electrical activity of the heart"
EEG-OTHER,"Other EEG: EEG channels where the location cannot be found"
MOTION,"Motion: Measures movement or acceleration (e.g., via accelerometer)"
MISC,"Miscellaneous: Any other signal type not fitting standard categories"
AUDIO,"Audio: Sound recording (e.g., via microphone)"
